/**
 * Which key saves a comment (#1934).
 *
 * Every comment composer (the plan / annotate comment popover, the panel's
 * edit box, code review's line, file and general comments, the Inbox's file
 * comments) asks this one question, so a single setting governs them all.
 *
 * - Cmd/Ctrl+Enter always saves, whatever the setting says.
 * - With `enterSaves` (Settings → General → "Enter saves a comment", the
 *   cookie-only `enterSavesComment`, off by default) a plain Enter saves too
 *   and Shift+Enter is left to the field, which adds a new line.
 * - An Enter that belongs to an input method (Japanese, Chinese, Korean IME)
 *   never saves: `isComposing`, or the legacy `keyCode` 229 Safari reports for
 *   the Enter that commits a composition.
 *
 * The skill and mention menus are offered the key BEFORE this check by every
 * caller, so an arrowed-to row still takes Enter.
