/**
 * A paste aimed at nothing goes to the text field the person was writing in.
 *
 * Dictation apps (Hex, and most others on macOS) insert their text by putting
 * it on the clipboard and posting a synthetic ⌘V to the front app. The paste
 * lands in whatever has focus at that moment. In the Inbox, focus often leaves
 * the field the person is writing in without them noticing: a click on a
 * question card's choice moves it to that radio or checkbox, a click on a
 * message's text or on a chip in the reply box moves it to the page, while
 * the reply box stays open (and keeps its border). A ⌘V then pastes into
 * nothing, and the dictated words are lost, seemingly at random.
 *
 * So: the window remembers the text fields that last had focus (the reply
 * box, a question card's note or Other field, compose, a comment box, any
 * input), and when a ⌘V (Ctrl+V off macOS) arrives while focus is on
 * something that takes no text, it puts focus back in the newest of them that
 * is still on screen, the caret where the person left it (a range they had
 * selected collapses to its end, so the dictation replaces nothing), before
 * the browser runs the paste. The keydown is never cancelled, so the
 * browser's own paste runs (Chrome runs it after the page has handled the
 * keydown), now into the field. (On Chrome 155-156 on macOS, which drops a
 * synthetic ⌘V's text, the page then inserts a plain-text paste itself:
 * `@plannotator/ui/utils/pasteInsert`.)
 *
 * Nothing changes when focus is already in a text field or inside a frame (an
 * attached HTML page), when text is selected in an attached file's viewer or
 * a guided review, or a selection toolbar shows (the person is about to comment on it), or when
 * no remembered field is on screen: gone, hidden, disabled, read-only,
 * scrolled out of view (out of the window, or clipped by its pane), behind a
 * modal dialog, under a full-screen file or a guided review, or with
 * something else drawn over it.
