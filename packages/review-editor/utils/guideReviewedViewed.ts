/**
 * Guided Review (#1786): which files ticking section `index` "Reviewed" marks
 * viewed.
 *
 * A file is marked only once EVERY section that shows it is ticked. A chapter
 * can show just part of a file (the guide may place one file in several
 * chapters), and "Viewed" means the whole file was read, so ticking the first
 * chapter of a split file must not check it off while its other hunks are
 * still ahead. Ticking the last of its chapters does.
 *
 * Only paths in `filesInDiff` (the diff on screen) are returned: guide refs go
 * stale when the diff changes after generation, and viewed state is keyed by
 * the files of the current review. Already viewed files are returned too; the
 * caller's mark is idempotent.
 *
 * Un-ticking marks nothing and unmarks nothing: the files stay as they are
 * (the approved behavior), so this returns [] when the section is already
 * ticked.
